ðŸŽ“ Education Journey

My journey into technology wasn't traditional. Initially, IT didn't excite me when I began my Diploma in Information Technology in 2018. My grades were average, reflecting my lack of passion. Everything changed when I pursued my Bachelor's in Software Engineering in 2020. Courses in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning ignited a profound interest, pushing me to explore deeper. My pivotal moment came with my final year project, where I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Facial Expression Recognition. Despite hardware limitationsâ€”a GTX1050 GPUâ€”I successfully achieved around 70% accuracy, fueling my passion further.

ðŸ’» Professional Experience

Entering the AI industry right after graduation proved challenging due to high entry barriers. Determined, I embarked on self-guided learning, mastering Java for backend development and Python for AI applications. I secured a role as a Software Engineer, developing extensive expertise in Java Spring Boot and DevOps, while simultaneously undertaking personal AI projects. Today, nearly two years into my professional journey, I am proficient in Java, Spring Boot, DevOps, and Python-based AI initiatives.

ðŸš€ Career Aspirations

I'm dedicated to innovation within the AI and tech industries, continuously enhancing my skills and contributing impactful technological solutions.
