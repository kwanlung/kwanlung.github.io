# üß† Motivation
My initial attempt at facial expression recognition, completed during my university studies, involved a convolutional neural network (CNN). Despite limited resources‚Äîa modest GTX 1050 GPU and sparse datasets‚ÄîI managed to achieve an accuracy between 65-75%. Although promising, it wasn't sufficient for real-world applications, particularly for something as sensitive as mental health diagnostics.

Fast forward to today: armed with greater experience, advanced hardware (RTX 3060), and modern ML frameworks, I revisited this challenge using Vision Transformers (ViT). The goal was clear: surpass 80% accuracy and deepen my expertise in state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

# üìä Objective
Build and deploy a robust 7-class facial expression recognition system capable of accurately identifying fundamental human emotions:

- Anger

- Disgust

- Fear

- Happiness

- Neutral

- Sadness

- Surprise

# üñºÔ∏è Image Processing & Embedding Systems

To enable high-performing ViT-based emotion classification, the system depends heavily on rigorous image processing and efficient visual embedding strategies.

### üì¶ Preprocessing Pipeline
Each image undergoes a well-designed set of operations:

- **Face Region Isolation:** All datasets are either pre-aligned (RAF-DB, AffectNet) or assume center-cropped faces.

#### üìå Transformations Applied (PyTorch)
Training augmentations were applied via `torchvision.transforms`, using the following logic:

- **Resize:** All images resized to 224x224 (ViT input)
- **Random Horizontal Flip:** Helps the model generalize across left/right facial symmetry
- **Random Rotation (¬±10¬∞):** Adds rotation invariance, useful for slightly tilted faces
- **Color Jitter:** Adjusts brightness, contrast, and saturation for lighting diversity
- **Normalization:** Converts RGB to standardized values in range `[-1, 1]`

<details>
<summary>PyTorch Implementation</summary>

```python
transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.ColorJitter(...),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize([0.5]*3, [0.5]*3)
])
```
</details>

#### ‚úÇÔ∏è CutMix Augmentation
Beyond traditional transforms, I integrated CutMix, a powerful augmentation technique that:

- Cuts a patch from one image and pastes it into another

- Mixes the labels proportionally

- Helps the model learn spatial invariance and improves generalization under occlusion or noise

This was particularly effective for small classes like fear and disgust.

> CutMix is especially useful when training ViTs, as they handle global patterns better than CNNs and benefit more from mixed-structure inputs.


### üß† Embedding System: Vision Transformer

- The input image is embedded into a patch-level sequence using `patch_size=16`.

- Each patch is linearly projected and positional embeddings are added before being fed into the transformer encoder.

- Outputs are globally pooled and passed into a linear classification head.

ViT thus converts `(B, 3, 224, 224)` into a sequence `(B, N_patches, D)` which is finally pooled into `(B, D)` before classification.

# üèóÔ∏è Dataset Engineering
Effective data handling was crucial to the project's success. Typical facial expression recognition (FER) datasets suffer from noise, inconsistencies, and imbalance. I tackled these issues directly:



| Dataset     | Link                                                                 | Notes                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| FER+        | [ferplus-7cls](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deanngkl/ferplus-7cls)         | Reduced and standardized to seven fundamental emotions   |
| AffectNet   | [affectnet_no_contempt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deanngkl/affectnet_no_contempt) | Removed the less relevant 'contempt' class to align with the project's emotion set       |
| RAF-DB      | [raf-db-7emotions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deanngkl/raf-db-7emotions)      | Addressed multiple data issues by manually augmenting neutral expressions from FER+ and standardizing labels    |

These enhanced datasets collectively provided 75,398 training and 8,377 validation samples, offering sufficient variety and balance to effectively train the model.

# üß™ Advanced Model Training
The backbone for this project was ViT-Tiny (patch16_224) provided by timm, offering powerful performance even under hardware constraints. Key elements of my optimized training workflow included:

- Optimizer: AdamW for adaptive gradient handling.

- Scheduler: Cosine annealing learning rate with warmup phases, aiding convergence and stability.

- Augmentation: Implemented CutMix and horizontal flipping, significantly improving generalization.

- Mixed Precision Training (AMP): Enabled faster computations and reduced memory footprint, crucial for efficient GPU utilization.

## Sample Training Workflow:
```bash
python train.py
```

## Interactive Model Deployment:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --host localhost --port 8000 --reload
```

# üìà Performance & Insights
The model achieved a remarkable 82.2% validation accuracy, with balanced precision and recall across emotions, notably excelling in recognizing happiness (93.4%) and neutrality (91.8%). This demonstrates ViT's effectiveness in handling complex visual patterns compared to traditional CNN-based methods.

    - ViT-Tiny is excellent for constrained environments, providing near state-of-the-art accuracy.

    - Meticulous dataset preparation significantly enhances model performance.

    - Data augmentation strategies like CutMix, paired with cosine LR scheduling, lead to robust learning.

    - Publicly sharing datasets enhances reproducibility and fosters community engagement.

# üîÆ Future Directions
To further push the boundaries of this project, the following advancements are planned:

- Scaling Up: Experiment with ViT-Base architecture combined with LoRA fine-tuning to capture more intricate visual patterns.

- PHQ Score Integration: Incorporate a regression head to predict Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) scores from facial expressions, directly targeting depression detection.

- Interactive Demos: Create user-friendly interfaces using Streamlit or Gradio for broader accessibility.

# üöß Challenges & Solutions
- Dataset Complexity: Integrating multiple disparate datasets was non-trivial. Custom preprocessing scripts resolved inconsistencies and improved data quality.

- Resource Constraints: Opting for ViT-Tiny balanced model complexity and hardware limitations (RTX 3060).

- Regression Task (PHQ): Initially planned, the regression task required extensive multimodal video data. Limited access led to postponement, but groundwork has been laid for future integration.
